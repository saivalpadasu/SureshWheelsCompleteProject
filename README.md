# Suresh Wheels Complete Project
## I have developed this complete responsive front-end website for a business  (i.e., Suresh Wheels) when they hired me for an internship.
### This front-end website, which is fully responsive, provides information on several elements of the company, as detailed below;
- **Front Landing Page:** Services offered by the business, Exact location of the store via Google Maps, Tyre brands available with them and footer section.
- **Tyre Finder Page:** This page outlines the different numbers that are printed on tyres to determine their precise measurements and specifications.
- **About Us Page:** Which explains about the business and also gives information about wheel balancing and wheel alignment.
- **Book Online Page:** This page enables customers to either directly order tyres to be delivered or picked up at the store, which will save them a tonne of time, or reserve a slot online using the form that is linked. This form is a google form displayed directly to the website using iframe element in HTML.
